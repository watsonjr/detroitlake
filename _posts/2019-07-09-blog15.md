## Bloom Forecast July 9 - July 16
Our models suggest that blooms are still very likely at Detroit Lake, and that there remains a chance that toxins will occur.

__Probability of occurrence (%) of different algal concentrations (left) and whether a toxin will be  present in the water (right) in the next week (note that the toxin predictions are still highly      experimental).__

## Latest lake conditions
Water samples from the lake were analyzed last week for nutrients and algal concentrations. In       addition, information on the weather was collected. These data are presented below as a percentage   of their historical maximum.

__Last sampled conditions at Detroit Lake, including the weather (temperature, wind, rain and        sunlight) as well as the total concentration of algae (log transformed), nutrients (total phosphates and nitrates) and  toxins (N/A denotes unavailable data).__

## Where we are in the season
It is July; this is the middle of the harmful algal bloom season.
