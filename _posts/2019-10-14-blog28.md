## Bloom Forecast October 14 - October 21
The HAB season is coming to an end, but slowly: algal blooms can still occur at Detroit Lake.      Weather forecasts suggest that water temperatures at the lake will continue to decline, discouraging further growth, but our models still indicate that there may be the chance of a HAB.

## Latest lake conditions
Water samples were analyzed last week for nutrients and algal concentrations. In addition,           information on the weather was collected. These data are presented below as a percentage of their    historical maximum.

## Where we are in the season
Past bloom seasons have typically ended at this point in the year. However, some toxic algal         activity has been detected at the lake and is being monitored. As we move through October we can     expect the algae levels to decline as cooler weather arrives and sunlight diminishes.
