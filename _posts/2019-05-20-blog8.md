## Bloom Forecast May 20 - May 27
Our models suggest that there will continue to be a relatively high concentration of algae in Detroit Lake over the next week, and that toxins may occur.

## Latest lake conditions
Water samples from the lake were analyzed last week for nutrients and algal concentrations. In       addition, information on the weather was collected. These data are presented below as a percentage   of their historical maximum.

## Where we are in the season
It is May and historically this is the start of the harmful algal bloom season. It is also the time  of the year with the greatest bloom activity.
