## Bloom Forecast Apr 8 - Apr 15
Our models suggest that in the next week there may be increased levels of algae in the lake, but     that toxins are unlikely to occur.

## Latest lake conditions
Water samples from the lake were analyzed for nutrients and algal concentrations. In addition,       information on the weather was collected. These data are presented below as a percentage of their    historical maxima.

## Where we are in the season
It is April and historically there have been very few algal blooms this month, although the season   could start early.
