## Bloom Forecast June 17 - June 24
Our models suggest that over the next week algae blooms are likely, and that toxins are a            possibility too.

__Probability of occurrence (%) of different algal concentrations (left) and whether a toxin will be  present in the water (right) in the next week (note that the toxin predictions are still highly      experimental).__

## Latest lake conditions
Water samples from the lake were analyzed last week for nutrients and algal concentrations. In       addition, information on the weather was collected. These data are presented below as a percentage   of their historical maximum.

__Last sampled conditions at Detroit Lake, including the weather (temperature, wind, rain and        sunlight) as well as the total concentration of algae (log transformed), nutrients (total phosphates and nitrates) and  toxins (N/A denotes unavailable data).__

## Where we are in the season
It is June and historically this is the middle of the harmful algal bloom season.
