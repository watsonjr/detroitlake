## Bloom Forecast June 10 - June 17
Our models suggest that an algae bloom is likely, and that there may be toxins occuring sometime in  the next week.

## Latest lake conditions
Water samples from the lake were analyzed last week for nutrients and algal concentrations. In       addition, information on the weather was collected. These data are presented below as a percentage   of their historical maximum.

__Last sampled conditions at Detroit Lake, including the weather (temperature, wind, rain and        sunlight) as well as the total concentration of algae (log transformed), nutrients (total phosphates and nitrates) and  toxins (N/A denotes unavailable data).__

## Where we are in the season
It is June and historically this is the middle of the harmful algal bloom season.
