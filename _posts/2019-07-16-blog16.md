__Probability of occurrence (%) of different algal concentrations (left) and whether a toxin will be  present in the water (right) in the next week (note that the toxin predictions are still highly      experimental).__

## Latest lake conditions
Water samples from the lake were analyzed last week for nutrients and algal concentrations. In       addition, information on the weather was collected. These data are presented below as a percentage   of their historical maximum.

## Where we are in the season
It is July; this is the middle of the harmful algal bloom season.
