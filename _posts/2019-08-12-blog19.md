## Latest lake conditions
Water samples from the lake were analyzed last week for nutrients and algal concentrations. In       addition, information on the weather was collected. These data are presented below as a percentage   of their historical maximum.

__Last sampled conditions at Detroit Lake, including the weather (temperature, wind, rain and        sunlight) as well as the total concentration of algae (log transformed), nutrients (total phosphates and nitrates) and  toxins (N/A denotes unavailable data).__

## Where we are in the season
We are midway through the summer. Historically, August is well within the algal bloom season, which can stretch into the fall for some water bodies.
