## Bloom Forecast June 3 - June 11
Our models suggest that algae will remain abundant in Detroit Lake over the next week, and that toxins may occur.

## Latest lake conditions
Water samples from the lake were analyzed last week for nutrients and algal concentrations. In       addition, information on the weather was collected. These data are presented below as a percentage   of their historical maximum.

__Last sampled conditions at Detroit Lake, including the weather (temperature, wind, rain and        sunlight) as well as the total concentration of algae (log transformed), nutrients (total phosphates and nitrates) and  toxins (N/A denotes unavailable data).__

## Where we are in the season
Detroit Lake often experiences algal blooms in June, some of which are toxin-producing. It is still early in the season, and June is a month with considerable chance for a bloom event.
