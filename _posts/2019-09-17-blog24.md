## Bloom Forecast September 17 - September 24
The season is near its end, but algal blooms are still likely at Detroit Lake.

__Probability of occurrence (%) of different algal concentrations (left) and whether a toxin will    be  present in the water (right) in the next week (note that the toxin predictions are still         highly      experimental, and correspond to water at the lake before transport and treatment).__

## Latest lake conditions
Water samples from the lake were analyzed last week for nutrients and algal concentrations. In       addition, information on the weather was collected. These data are presented below as a percentage   of their historical maximum.

__Last sampled conditions at Detroit Lake, including the weather (temperature, wind, rain and        sunlight) as well as the total concentration of algae (log transformed), nutrients (total phosphates and nitrates) and  toxins (N/A denotes unavailable data).__

## Where we are in the season
September is towards the end of the bloom season. We can expect the algae levels to decline as       cooler weather arrives and sunlight diminishes.
