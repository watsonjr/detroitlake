## Bloom Forecast September 3 - September 10
Algal blooms are still likely at Detroit Lake. Toxins may occur as well in the next seven days.

__Probability of occurrence (%) of different algal concentrations (left) and whether a toxin will be  present in the water (right) in the next week (note that the toxin predictions are still highly      experimental), and correspond to water at the lake before transport and treatment.__

## Latest lake conditions
Water samples from the lake were analyzed last week for nutrients and algal concentrations. In       addition, information on the weather was collected. These data are presented below as a percentage   of their historical maximum.

__Last sampled conditions at Detroit Lake, including the weather (temperature, wind, rain and        sunlight) as well as the total concentration of algae (log transformed), nutrients (total phosphates and nitrates) and  toxins (N/A denotes unavailable data).__

## Where we are in the season
September is towards the end of the bloom season. We can expect the algae levels to decline as cooler weather arrives and light exposure declines.
