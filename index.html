introduction: |
  [The Prediction Lab](https://www.thepredictionlab.com/) produces short, medium and long-term forecasts of harmful algal blooms in Detroit Lake, OR. We use Big Data collected from the lake, including water samples taken directly from the lake, as well as information on local and regional weather. We also make use of satellite imagery, to measure changes in the color of the lake. All these information are fed into Machine Learning algorithms that provide:
  
  - 3-day, 10-day and 30-day forecasts about cyanobacteria concentrations and algal toxin levls
  - We also estimate the uncertainty about our predictions
  - We also learn about what drives the occurence of harmful algal blooms
