## Bloom Forecast July 16 - July 23
Our models expect an algal bloom at Detroit Lake over the next week, and that there remains a chance that toxins will occur.

## Latest lake conditions
Water samples from the lake were analyzed last week for nutrients and algal concentrations. In       addition, information on the weather was collected. These data are presented below as a percentage   of their historical maximum.

## Where we are in the season
It is July; this is the middle of the harmful algal bloom season.
